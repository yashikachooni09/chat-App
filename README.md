# chat-App
A simple real-time chat application built using Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, and WebSocket. This beginner-friendly project allows multiple users to join a chat room and send messages in real time. The project helped me understand how WebSockets work and how to use Socket.IO for real-time communication in web applications.
